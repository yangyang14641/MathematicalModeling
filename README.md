## Acknowledgement
### Prof. Xiao (Jian Xiao) is the teacher of Mathematical Modeling Course, his taught us a lot both in method and technique in building mathematical modeling. His homeworks were really full of challenge -- Simulate really Mathematical Contest in Modeling (MCM), Each homework was a crazy voyage for us in that time, in case of our poor knowledge in math and computer science. Yet we never gave it up and keep going, Therefore we gained much in that course. At the end of that term, Our team passed the Qulification Contest successfully.
### Our Team: Zhe Liu (Our Professional Programmer), Ying Xiong (Our Professional Academic Writer), Yang Yang(Mathematical advisor, Team Leader and Assistant for Liu and Xiong)
